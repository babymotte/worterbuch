clear(key)/pclear(pattern)
clear removes a single value for the provided key, pclear removes all values of keys matching the provided pattern

publish(key,value)
subscribers to key or a pattern matching key will be notified of the value but it won't be put into the store

subu(key)/psubu(pattern)
subscribe to unique values of a key. The behavior is the same as sub/psub except subscribers don't get notified if a key is set to the value it already has
Should this be a parameter of the sub/psub functions?

get rid of nonblocking decoder, messages should have known length
length of the message must either be the first or second fixed size number in the packet or messages must be base64 encoded and delimited by a line break

add handshake. first version should just be a an initial message form the server to the client telling it its supported protocol versions and separator and wildcard characters
later iterations may include an authentication request, TLS key exchanges etc.
